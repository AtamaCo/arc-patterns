# What is this?

This is a potential CloudFront Function compatible bit of code that could run in a Function. THAT SAID IT WON'T WORK OR IF IT DOES RUN IT WONT DO ANYTHING USEFUL, because CloudFront functions it turns out don't run at origin response. 

The important / valuable thing here is just that it's the tsconfig required to generate a plain old JS file. This might be workable but not currently sure.
